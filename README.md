*How to use it?*

Point it to the folder where you keep .lsx files. You can decompile them from [Patches to VFX Heads](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/353) mod. Enter in `vanilla UUID` the id of the head you custom is based on, and in the `custom UUID` enter your head UUID. Click save. Program will backup your data, and then it will enter new entry with `custom UUID` and autoamticaly deduced `slot index` to files already containing `vanilla UUID` entries. Ta-da.
